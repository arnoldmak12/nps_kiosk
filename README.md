# Capital One 2019 Software Engineering Summit Submission
This application is my submission to the challenge of building an information kiosk for the National Park Service.

## Getting Started
Simply click the following link: and it'll take you to the default page. To begin actual use of the site you must click the sidebar icons on the right. The main functionality you'll use is the search option. To use this click the search icon, and then type in your search criteria in the search bars. To submit either press enter or click the blue search icon on the most right search bar. The results will be listed and can be clicked on to see more specific info. Once a specific entry is clicked all the relevant info will be displayed. To search again just change one of the search bars and then submit again.
